Amazon S3

CRR (Cross-region replication): enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different AWS Regions.

Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9's).

Consistency: Strong consistency for all operations (PUTs/DELETEs).

Bucket names rules:

Names must be unique across all of AWS.

Names must be 3 to 63 characters in length.

Names can only contain lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens.

Amazon S3 storage classes (2026):

S3 Standard -> Frequently accessed data.

S3 Standard-IA -> Infrequent access, rapid retrieval.

S3 One Zone-IA -> Cost-effective, single AZ (less durable).

S3 Intelligent-Tiering -> Unknown/changing access patterns (Auto-tiering).

S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval -> Millisecond retrieval for rare access.

S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval -> Minutes to hours.

S3 Glacier Deep Archive -> Lowest cost, 12-48 hours.

Multipart upload can be used to speed up uploads to S3.

"MFA delete" adds a layer of additional security to prevent accidental deletion.

Amazon S3 objects consist of: Key, Value, Version ID, Metadata.

Object lifecycle management: Automated rules to transfer objects between classes or expire them.

Standard-IA and One Zone-IA both have a minimum storage duration charge of 30 days.
